# Breast Cancer Models

This repository contains machine learning models built for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Models:
- `NagaMopidevi_RandomForest_v1.ipynb`: A Random Forest classification model.
- `NagaMopidevi_SVM_V2.ipynb`: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Both models are trained and evaluated for breast cancer diagnosis classification.
